/**
 * The AuthCookieService class is a service responsible to handle
 * all operations and helpers required in a standard browser context
 * based on the cookies to remove the dependency between cookies
 * and auth from the Clerk instance.
 * This service is responsible to:
 *   - refresh the session cookie using a poller
 *   - refresh the session cookie on tab visibility change
 *   - update the related cookies listening to the `token:update` event
 *   - initialize auth related cookies for development instances (eg __client_uat, __clerk_db_jwt)
 *   - cookie setup for production / development instances
 * It also provides the following helpers:
 *   - isSignedOut(): check if the current user is signed-out using cookies
 *   - decorateUrlWithDevBrowserToken(): decorates url with auth related info (eg dev browser jwt)
 *   - handleUnauthenticatedDevBrowser(): resets dev browser in case of invalid dev browser
 *   - setEnvironment(): update cookies (eg client_uat) related to environment
